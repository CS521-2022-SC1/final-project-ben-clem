<h1 align="center">Final Project: Data Analysis with Python</h1>

# Topic

Open-Ended option: **Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network**

- Will start with an easy dataset such as [Fruits 360](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits), and a basic sequential CNN model.
- If accuracy > 90%, will try a harder one like [Cat and Dog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog) or [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset).
- If accuracy < 90%, will try using transfer learning with ResNet50, and experimenting with data augmentation, learning rate schedule, and early stopping.
